		<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">Danny Meadow Mouse Is Worried</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>Danny Meadow Mouse sat on his door-step with his
		chin in his hands, and it was very plain to see that Danny
		had something on his mind. He had only a nod for Jimmy
		Skunk, and even Peter Rabbit could get no more than a
		grumpy &#8220;Good morning.&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t that he had been
		caught napping the day before by Reddy Fox and nearly
		made an end of. No, it wasn&#8217;t that. Danny had learned
		his lesson, and Reddy would never catch him again. It
		wasn&#8217;t that he was all alone with no one to play with. Danny
		was rather glad that he was alone. The fact is, Danny
		Meadow Mouse was worried.</p>

		<p>Now worry is one of the worst things in the world,
		and it didn&#8217;t seem as if there was anything that Danny
		Meadow Mouse need worry about. But you know it is
		the easiest thing in the world to find something to worry
		over and make yourself uncomfortable about. And when
		you make yourself uncomfortable, you are almost sure to
		<a class="pagenum" id="page2" title="2">&nbsp;</a>make everyone around you equally uncomfortable. It was
		so with Danny Meadow Mouse. Striped Chipmunk had
		twice called him &#8220;Cross Patch&#8221; that morning, and Johnny
		Chuck, who had fought Reddy Fox for him the day before,
		had called him &#8220;Grumpy.&#8221; And what do you think
		was the matter with Danny Meadow Mouse? Why, he
		was worrying because his tail was short. Yes, sir, that is all
		that ailed Danny Meadow Mouse that bright morning.</p>

		<p>You know some people let their looks make them miserable.
		They worry because they are homely or freckled,
		or short or tall, or thin or stout, all of which is very foolish.
		And Danny Meadow Mouse was just as foolish in worrying
		because his tail was short.</p>

		<p>It is short! It certainly is all of that! Danny never had
		realized how short until he chanced to meet his cousin
		Whitefoot, who lives in the Green Forest. He was very elegantly
		dressed, but the most imposing thing about him
		was his long, slim, beautiful tail. Danny had at once become
		conscious of his own stubby little tail, and he had
		hardly had pride enough to hold his head up as became
		an honest Meadow Mouse. Ever since he had been thinking
		and thinking, and wondering how his family came to
		<a class="pagenum" id="page3" title="3">&nbsp;</a>have such short tails. Then he grew envious and began
		to wish and wish and wish that he could have a long tail
		like his cousin Whitefoot.</p>

		<p>He was so busy wishing that he had a long tail that he
		quite forgot to take care of the tail he did have, and he
		pretty nearly lost it and his life with it. Old Whitetail the
		Marsh Hawk spied Danny sitting there moping on his
		doorstep, and came sailing over the tops of the meadow
		grasses so softly that he all but caught Danny. If it hadn&#8217;t
		been for one of the Merry Little Breezes, Danny would
		have been caught. And all because he was envious. It&#8217;s a
		bad, bad habit.</p>

		<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">Danny Meadow Mouse and His Short Tail</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>All Danny Meadow Mouse could think about was his
		short tail. He was so ashamed of it that whenever anyone
		passed, he crawled out of sight so that they should not see
		how short his tail was. Instead of playing in the sunshine as
		he used to do, he sat and sulked. Pretty soon his friends
		began to pass without stopping. Finally one day old Mr.
		Toad sat down in front of Danny and began to ask questions.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked old Mr. Toad.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; replied Danny Meadow Mouse.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose there really is anything the matter, but
		what do you think is the matter?&#8221; said old Mr. Toad.</p>

		<p>Danny fidgeted, and old Mr. Toad looked up at jolly,
		round, red Mr. Sun and winked. &#8220;Sun is just as bright
		as ever, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Danny.</p>

		 <!-- Original Location of illo-1 -->

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Got plenty to eat and drink, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221; continued
		Mr. Toad.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Danny.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Seems to me that that is a pretty good-looking suit of
		clothes you&#8217;re wearing,&#8221; said Mr. Toad, eyeing Danny
		critically. &#8220;Sunny weather, plenty to eat and drink, and
		good clothes&#8212;must be you don&#8217;t know when you&#8217;re well
		off, Danny Meadow Mouse.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Danny hung his head. Finally he looked up and caught
		a kindly twinkle in old Mr. Toad&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;Mr. Toad, how
		can I get a long tail like my cousin Whitefoot of the Green
		Forest?&#8221; he asked.</p>

		<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s what&#8217;s the matter! Ha! ha! ha! Danny
		Meadow Mouse, I&#8217;m ashamed of you! I certainly am
		ashamed of you!&#8221; said Mr. Toad. &#8220;What good would
		a long tail do you? Tell me that.&#8221;</p>

		<p>For a minute Danny didn&#8217;t know just what to say. &#8220;I&#8212;I&#8212;I&#8217;d
		look so much better if I had a long tail,&#8221; he ventured.</p>

		<p>Old Mr. Toad just laughed. &#8220;You never saw a Meadow
		Mouse with a long tail, did you? Of course not. What a
		sight it would be! Why, everybody on the Green Meadows
		<a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7">&nbsp;</a>would laugh themselves sick at the sight! You see you
		need to be slim and trim and handsome to carry a long
		tail well. And then what a nuisance it would be! You
		would always have to be thinking of your tail and taking
		care to keep it out of harm&#8217;s way. Look at me. I&#8217;m homely.
		Some folks call me ugly to look at. But no one tries to
		catch me as Farmer Brown&#8217;s boy does Billy Mink because
		of his fine coat; and no one wants to put me in a cage
		because of a fine voice. I am satisfied to be just as I am,
		and if you&#8217;ll take my advice, Danny Meadow Mouse,
		you&#8217;ll be satisfied to be just as you are.&#8221;</p>

		<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">Danny Meadow Mouse Plays Hide and Seek</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>Life is always a game of hide and seek to Danny
		Meadow Mouse. You see, he is such a fat little fellow
		that there are a great many other furry-coated people, and
		almost as many who wear feathers, who would gobble
		Danny up for breakfast or for dinner if they could. Some
		of them pretend to be his friends, but Danny always keeps
		his eyes open when they are around and always begins
		to play hide and seek. Peter Rabbit and Jimmy Skunk
		and Striped Chipmunk and Happy Jack Squirrel are all
		friends whom he can trust, but he always has a bright
		twinkling eye open for Reddy Fox and Billy Mink and
		Shadow the Weasel and old Whitetail the Marsh Hawk,
		and several more, especially Hooty the Owl at night.</p>

		<p>Now Danny Meadow Mouse is a stout-hearted little
		fellow, and when rough Brother North Wind came shouting
		across the Green Meadows, tearing to pieces the snow
		clouds and shaking out the snowflakes until they covered
		<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9">&nbsp;</a>the Green Meadows deep, deep, deep, Danny just snuggled
		down in his warm coat in his snug little house of
		grass and waited. Danny liked the snow. Yes, sir, Danny
		Meadow Mouse liked the snow. He just loved to dig in
		it and make tunnels. Through those tunnels in every direction
		he could go where he pleased and when he pleased
		without being seen by anybody. It was great fun!</p>

		<p>Every little way he made a little round doorway up
		beside a stiff stalk of grass. Out of this he could peep at the
		white world, and he could get the fresh cold air. Sometimes,
		when he was quite sure that no one was around,
		he would scamper across on top of the snow from one
		doorway to another, and when he did this, he made the
		prettiest little footprints.</p>

		<p>Now Reddy Fox knew all about those doorways and
		who made them. Reddy was having hard work to get
		enough to eat this cold weather, and he was hungry most
		of the time. One morning, as he came tiptoeing softly
		over the meadows, what should he see just ahead of him
		but the head of Danny Meadow Mouse pop out of one
		of those little round doorways. Reddy&#8217;s mouth watered,
		and he stole forward more softly than ever. When he got
		<a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10">&nbsp;</a>within jumping distance, he drew his stout hind legs under
		him and made ready to spring. Presto! Danny Meadow
		Mouse had disappeared! Reddy Fox jumped just the same
		and began to dig as fast as he could make his paws go.
		He could smell Danny Meadow Mouse and that made
		him almost frantic.</p>

		<p>All the time Danny Meadow Mouse was scurrying along
		one of his little tunnels, and when finally Reddy Fox
		stopped digging because he was quite out of breath, Danny
		popped his head out of another little doorway and laughed
		at Reddy. Of course Reddy saw him, and of course Reddy
		tried to catch him there, and dug frantically just as before.
		And of course Danny Meadow Mouse wasn&#8217;t there.</p>

		<p>After a while Reddy Fox grew tired of this kind of a
		game and tried another plan. The next time he saw Danny
		Meadow Mouse stick his head out, Reddy pretended not
		to see him. He stretched himself out on the ground and
		made believe that he was very tired and sleepy. He closed
		his eyes. Then he opened them just the tiniest bit, so that
		he could see Danny Meadow Mouse and yet seem to be
		asleep. Danny watched him for a long time. Then he
		chuckled to himself and dropped out of sight.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11">&nbsp;</a>No sooner was he gone than Reddy Fox stole over
		close to the little doorway and waited. &#8220;He&#8217;ll surely stick
		his head out again to see if I&#8217;m asleep, and then I&#8217;ll have
		him,&#8221; said Reddy to himself. So he waited and waited
		and waited. By and by he turned his head. There was
		Danny Meadow Mouse at another little doorway laughing
		at him!</p>

		<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">Old Granny Fox Tries for Danny Meadow Mouse</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>Danny Meadow Mouse had not enjoyed anything so
		much for a long time as he did that game of hide and
		seek. He tickled and chuckled all the afternoon as he
		thought about it. Of course Reddy had been &#8220;it.&#8221; He had
		been &#8220;it&#8221; all the time, for never once had he caught Danny
		Meadow Mouse. If he had&#8212;well, there wouldn&#8217;t have
		been any more stories about Danny Meadow Mouse, because
		there wouldn&#8217;t have been any Danny Meadow Mouse
		any more.</p>

		<p>But Danny never let himself think about this. He had
		enjoyed the game all the more because it had been such
		a dangerous game. It had been such fun to dive into one
		of his little round doorways in the snow, run along one
		of his own little tunnels, and then peep out at another
		doorway and watch Reddy Fox digging as fast as ever he
		could at the doorway Danny had just left. Finally Reddy
		had given up in disgust and gone off muttering angrily
		<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13">&nbsp;</a>to try to find something else for dinner. Danny had sat
		up on the snow and watched him go. In his funny little
		squeaky voice Danny shouted:</p>

		<div class="poem">
		    <p>&#8220;Though Reddy Fox is smart and sly,</p>
		    <p class="i2">Hi-hum-diddle-de-o!</p>
		    <p>I&#8217;m just as smart and twice as spry.</p>
		    <p class="i2">Hi-hum-diddle-de-o!&#8221;</p>
		</div>

		<p>That night Reddy Fox told old Granny Fox all about
		how he had tried to catch Danny Meadow Mouse. Granny
		listened with her head cocked on one side. When Reddy
		told how fat Danny Meadow Mouse was, her mouth watered.
		You see now that snow covered the Green Meadows
		and the Green Forest, Granny and Reddy Fox had hard
		work to get enough to eat, and they were hungry most
		of the time.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you down on the meadows to-morrow
		morning, and then we&#8217;ll see if Danny Meadow Mouse is
		as smart as he thinks he is,&#8221; said Granny Fox.</p>

		<p>So, bright and early the next morning, old Granny Fox
		and Reddy Fox went down on the meadows where Danny
		Meadow Mouse lives. Danny had felt in his bones that
		Reddy would come back, so he was watching, and he saw
		<a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14">&nbsp;</a>them as soon as they came out of the Green Forest. When
		he saw old Granny Fox, Danny&#8217;s heart beat a little faster
		than before, for he knew that Granny Fox is very smart
		and very wise and has learned most of the tricks of all
		the other little meadow and forest people.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This is going to be a more exciting game than the
		other,&#8221; said Danny to himself, and scurried down out of
		sight to see that all his little tunnels were clear so that he
		could run fast through them if he had to. Then he peeped
		out of one of his little doorways hidden in a clump of tall
		grass.</p>

		<p>Old Granny Fox set Reddy to hunting for Danny&#8217;s
		little round doorways, and as fast as he found them, Granny
		came up and sniffed at each. She knew that she could tell
		by the smell which one he had been at last. Finally she
		came straight towards the tall bunch of grass. Danny ducked
		down and scurried along one of his little tunnels. He heard
		Granny Fox sniff at the doorway he had just left. Suddenly
		something plunged down through the snow right
		at his very heels. Danny didn&#8217;t have to look to know that
		it was Granny Fox herself, and he squeaked with fright.</p>

		<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">What Happened on the Green Meadows</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>Thick and fast things were happening to Danny
		Meadow Mouse down on the snow-covered Green Meadows.
		Rather, they were almost happening. He hadn&#8217;t
		minded when Reddy Fox all alone tried to catch him. Indeed,
		he had made a regular game of hide and seek of it
		and had enjoyed it immensely. But now it was different.
		Granny Fox wasn&#8217;t so easily fooled as Reddy Fox. Just
		Granny alone would have made the game dangerous for
		Danny Meadow Mouse. But Reddy was with her, and so
		Danny had two to look out for, and he got so many frights
		that it seemed to him as if his heart had moved right up
		into his mouth and was going to stay there. Yes, sir, that
		is just how it seemed.</p>

		<p>Down in his little tunnels underneath the snow Danny
		Meadow Mouse felt perfectly safe from Reddy Fox, who
		would stop and dig frantically at the little round doorway
		where he had last seen Danny. But old Granny Fox knew
		<a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16">&nbsp;</a>all about those little tunnels, and she didn&#8217;t waste any time
		digging at the doorways. Instead she cocked her sharp
		little ears and listened with all her might. Now Granny
		Fox has very keen ears, oh, very keen ears, and she heard
		just what she hoped she would hear. She heard Danny
		Meadow Mouse running along one of his little tunnels
		under the snow.</p>

		<p>Plunge! Old Granny Fox dived right into the snow
		and right through into the tunnel of Danny Meadow
		Mouse. Her two black paws actually touched Danny&#8217;s tail.
		He was glad then that it was no longer.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; cried Granny Fox, &#8220;I almost got him that time!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Then she ran ahead a little way over the snow, listening
		as before. Plunge! Into the snow she went again. It
		was lucky for him that Danny had just turned into another
		tunnel, for otherwise she would surely have caught him.</p>

		<p>Granny Fox blew the snow out of her nose. &#8220;Next
		time I&#8217;ll get him!&#8221; said she.</p>

		<p>Now Reddy Fox is quick to learn, especially when it
		is a way to get something to eat. He watched Granny Fox,
		and when he understood what she was doing, he made
		up his mind to have a try himself, for he was afraid that
		<a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17">&nbsp;</a>if she caught Danny Meadow Mouse, she would think
		that he was not big enough to divide. Perhaps that was
		because Reddy is very selfish himself. So the next time
		Granny plunged into the snow and missed Danny Meadow
		Mouse just as before, Reddy rushed in ahead of her, and
		the minute he heard Danny running down below, he
		plunged in just as he had seen Granny do. But he didn&#8217;t
		take the pains to make sure of just where Danny was,
		and so of course he didn&#8217;t come anywhere near him. But
		he frightened Danny still more and made old Granny Fox
		lose her temper.</p>

		<p>Poor Danny Meadow Mouse! He had never been so
		frightened in all his life. He didn&#8217;t know which way to
		turn or where to run. And so he sat still, which, although
		he didn&#8217;t know it, was the very best thing he could do.
		When he sat still he made no noise, and so of course
		Granny and Reddy Fox could not tell where he was. Old
		Granny Fox sat and listened and listened and listened,
		and wondered where Danny Meadow Mouse was. And
		down under the snow Danny Meadow Mouse sat and
		listened and listened and listened, and wondered where
		Granny and Reddy Fox were.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; said Granny Fox after a while, &#8220;that Meadow
		Mouse thinks he can fool me by sitting still. I&#8217;ll give him
		a scare.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Then she began to plunge into the snow this way and
		that way, and sure enough, pretty soon she landed so close
		to Danny Meadow Mouse that one of her claws scratched
		him.</p>

		<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">Danny Meadow Mouse Remembers and Reddy Fox Forgets</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>&#8220;There he goes!&#8221; cried old Granny Fox. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let
		him sit still again!&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;I hear him!&#8221; shouted Reddy Fox, and plunged down
		into the snow just as Granny Fox had done a minute before.
		But he didn&#8217;t catch anything, and when he had blown
		the snow out of his nose and wiped it out of his eyes, he
		saw Granny Fox dive into the snow with no better luck.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Granny Fox, &#8220;as long as we keep
		him running, we can hear him, and some one of these
		times we&#8217;ll catch him. Pretty soon he&#8217;ll get too tired to
		be so spry, and when he is&#8212;&#8221; Granny didn&#8217;t finish, but
		licked her chops and smacked her lips. Reddy Fox grinned,
		then licked his chops and smacked his lips. Then once
		more they took turns diving into the snow.</p>

		<p>And down underneath in the little tunnels he had made,
		Danny Meadow Mouse was running for his life. He was
		getting tired, just as old Granny Fox had said he would.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20">&nbsp;</a>He was almost out of breath. He was sore and one leg
		smarted, for in one of her jumps old Granny Fox had so
		nearly caught him that her claws had torn his pants and
		scratched him.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! Oh, dear! If only I had time to think!&#8221;
		panted Danny Meadow Mouse, and then he squealed in
		still greater fright as Reddy Fox crashed down into his
		tunnel right at his very heels. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get somewhere!
		I&#8217;ve got to get somewhere where they can&#8217;t get at me!&#8221;
		he sobbed. And right that very instant he remembered
		the old fence-post!</p>

		<p>The old fence-post lay on the ground and was hollow.
		Fastened to it were long wires with sharp cruel barbs.
		Danny had made a tunnel over to that old fence-post the
		very first day after the snow came, for in that hollow in
		the old post he had a secret store of seeds. Why hadn&#8217;t
		he thought of it before? It must have been because he
		was too frightened to think. But he remembered now,
		and he dodged into the tunnel that led to the old fence-post,
		running faster than ever, for though his heart was
		in his mouth from fear, in his heart was hope, and hope
		is a wonderful thing.</p>

		<!-- Original Location of illo-2 -->

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22">&nbsp;</a>Now old Granny Fox knew all about that old fence-post
		and she remembered all about those barbed wires
		fastened to it. Although they were covered with snow
		she knew just about where they lay, and just before she
		reached them she stopped plunging down into the snow.
		Reddy Fox knew about those wires; too, but he was so
		excited that he forgot all about them.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; cried old Granny Fox sharply.</p>

		<p>But Reddy Fox didn&#8217;t hear, or if he heard he didn&#8217;t
		heed. His sharp ears could hear Danny Meadow Mouse
		running almost underneath him. Granny Fox could stop
		if she wanted to, but he was going to have Danny Meadow
		Mouse for his breakfast! Down into the snow he plunged
		as hard as ever he could.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Oh! Oh! Wow! Wow! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!&#8221;</p>

		<p>That wasn&#8217;t the voice of Danny Meadow Mouse. Oh,
		my, no! It was the voice of Reddy Fox. Yes, sir, it was
		the voice of Reddy Fox. He had landed with one of his
		black paws right on one of those sharp wire barbs, and
		it did hurt dreadfully.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I never did know a young Fox who could get into
		as much trouble as you can!&#8221; snapped old Granny Fox,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23">&nbsp;</a>as Reddy hobbled along on three legs behind her, across
		the snow-covered Green Meadows. &#8220;It serves you right
		for forgetting!&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; said Reddy meekly.</p>

		<p>And safe in the hollow of the old fence-post, Danny
		Meadow Mouse was dressing the scratch on his leg made
		by the claws of old Granny Fox.</p>

		<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">Old Granny Fox Tries a New Plan</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>Old Granny Fox kept thinking about Danny Meadow
		Mouse. She knew that he was fat, and it made her mouth
		water every time she thought of him. She made up her
		mind that she must and would have him. She knew that
		Danny had been very, very much frightened when she and
		Reddy Fox had tried so hard to catch him by plunging
		down through the snow into his little tunnels after him,
		and she felt pretty sure that he wouldn&#8217;t go far away from
		the old fence-post, in the hollow of which he was snug
		and safe.</p>

		<p>Old Granny Fox is very smart. &#8220;Danny Meadow Mouse
		won&#8217;t put his nose out of that old fence-post for a day or
		two. Then he&#8217;ll get tired of staying inside all the time, and
		he&#8217;ll peep out of one of his little round doorways to see if
		the way is clear. If he doesn&#8217;t see any danger, he&#8217;ll come
		out and run around on top of the snow to get some of the
		seeds in the tops of the tall grasses that stick out through the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25">&nbsp;</a>snow. If nothing frightens him, he&#8217;ll keep going, a little
		farther and a little farther from that old fence-post. I must
		see to it that Danny Meadow Mouse isn&#8217;t frightened for a
		few days.&#8221; So said old Granny Fox to herself, as she lay
		under a hemlock tree, studying how she could best get the
		next meal.</p>

		<p>Then she called Reddy Fox to her and forbade him to
		go down on the meadows until she should tell him he
		might. Reddy grumbled and mumbled and didn&#8217;t see why
		he shouldn&#8217;t go where he pleased, but he didn&#8217;t dare disobey.
		You see he had a sore foot. He had hurt it on a wire
		barb when he was plunging through the snow after Danny
		Meadow Mouse, and now he had to run on three legs.
		That meant that he must depend upon Granny Fox to help
		him get enough to eat. So Reddy didn&#8217;t dare to disobey.</p>

		<p>It all came out just as Granny Fox had thought it would.
		Danny Meadow Mouse <em>did</em> get tired of staying in the old
		fence-post. He <em>did</em> peep out first, and then he <em>did</em> run a
		little way on the snow, and then a little farther and a little
		farther. But all the time he took great care not to get more
		than a jump or two from one of his little round doorways
		leading down to his tunnels under the snow.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26">&nbsp;</a>Hidden on the edge of the Green Forest, Granny Fox
		watched him. She looked up at the sky, and she knew that
		it was going to snow again. &#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Tomorrow
		morning I&#8217;ll have fat Meadow Mouse for breakfast,&#8221;
		and she smiled a hungry smile.</p>

		<p>The next morning, before jolly, round, red Mr. Sun
		was out of bed, old Granny Fox trotted down onto the
		meadows and straight over to where, down under the
		snow, lay the old fence-post. It had snowed again, and all
		the little doorways of Danny Meadow Mouse were covered
		up with soft, fleecy snow. Behind Granny Fox limped
		Reddy Fox, grumbling to himself.</p>

		<p>When they reached the place where the old fence-post
		lay buried under the snow, old Granny Fox stretched out
		as flat as she could. Then she told Reddy to cover her up
		with the new soft snow. Reddy did as he was told, but all
		the time he grumbled. &#8220;Now you go off to the Green
		Forest and keep out of sight,&#8221; said Granny Fox. &#8220;By and
		by I&#8217;ll bring you some Meadow Mouse for your breakfast,&#8221;
		and Granny Fox chuckled to think how smart she
		was and how she was going to catch Danny Meadow
		Mouse.</p>

		<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">Brother North Wind Proves a Friend</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>Danny Meadow Mouse had seen nothing of old Granny
		Fox or Reddy Fox for several days. Every morning the first
		thing he did, even before he had breakfast, was to climb
		up to one of his little round doorways and peep out
		over the beautiful white meadows, to see if there was any
		danger near. But every time he did this, Danny used a
		different doorway. &#8220;For,&#8221; said Danny to himself, &#8220;if any
		one should happen, just happen, to see me this morning,
		they might be waiting just outside my doorway to catch
		me to-morrow morning.&#8221; You see there is a great deal of
		wisdom in the little head that Danny Meadow Mouse
		carries on his shoulders.</p>

		<p>But the first day and the second day and the third day
		he saw nothing of old Granny Fox or of Reddy Fox, and
		he began to enjoy running through his tunnels under the
		snow and scurrying across from one doorway to another
		on top of the snow, just as he had before the Foxes had
		<a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28">&nbsp;</a>tried so hard to catch him. But he hadn&#8217;t forgotten, as
		Granny Fox had hoped he would. No, indeed, Danny
		Meadow Mouse hadn&#8217;t forgotten. He was too wise for that.</p>

		<p>One morning, when he started to climb up to one of
		his little doorways, he found that it was closed. Yes, sir,
		it was closed. In fact, there wasn&#8217;t any doorway. More
		snow had fallen from the clouds in the night and had covered
		up every one of the little round doorways of Danny
		Meadow Mouse.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; said Danny, &#8220;I shall have a busy day, a very busy
		day, opening all my doorways. I&#8217;ll eat my breakfast, and
		then I&#8217;ll go to work.&#8221;</p>

		<p>So Danny Meadow Mouse ate a good breakfast of seeds
		which he had stored in the hollow in the old fence-post
		buried under the snow, and then he began work on the
		nearest doorway. It really wasn&#8217;t work at all, for you see
		the snow was soft and light, and Danny dearly loved to
		dig in it. In a few minutes he had made a wee hole through
		which he could peep up at jolly, round Mr. Sun. In a few
		minutes more he had made it big enough to put his head
		out. He looked this way and he looked that way. Far, far
		off on the top of a tree he could see old Roughleg the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29">&nbsp;</a>Hawk, but he was so far away that Danny didn&#8217;t fear him
		at all.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything or anybody to be afraid of,&#8221; said
		Danny and poked his head out a little farther.</p>

		<p>Then he sat and studied everything around him a long,
		long time. It was a beautiful white world, a very beautiful
		white world. Everything was so white and pure and beautiful
		that it didn&#8217;t seem possible that harm or danger for
		anyone could even be thought of. But Danny Meadow
		Mouse learned long ago that things are not always what
		they seem, and so he sat with just his little head sticking
		out of his doorway and studied and studied. Just a little
		way off was a little heap of snow.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember that,&#8221; said Danny. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t
		remember anything that would make that. There isn&#8217;t any
		little bush or old log or anything underneath it. Perhaps
		rough Brother North Wind heaped it up, just for fun.&#8221;</p>

		<p>But all the time Danny Meadow Mouse kept studying
		and studying that little heap of snow. Pretty soon he saw
		rough Brother North Wind coming his way and tossing
		the snow about as he came. He caught a handful from the
		top of the little heap of snow that Danny was studying,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30">&nbsp;</a>and when he had passed, Danny&#8217;s sharp eyes saw something
		red there. It was just the color of the cloak old
		Granny Fox wears.</p>

		<div class="poem">
		    <p>&#8220;Granny Fox, you can&#8217;t fool me!</p>
		    <p>I see you plain as plain can be!&#8221;</p>
		</div>

		<p>shouted Danny Meadow Mouse and dropped down out
		of sight, while old Granny Fox shook the snow from her
		red cloak and, with a snarl of disappointment and anger,
		slowly started for the Green Forest, where Reddy Fox was
		waiting for her.</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<p>&#8220;Tippy-toppy-tippy-toe,</p>
			<p>Play and frolic in the snow!</p>
			<p>Now you see me! Now you don&#8217;t!</p>
			<p>Think you&#8217;ll catch me, but you won&#8217;t!</p>
			<p>Tippy-toppy-tippy-toe,</p>
			<p>Oh, such fun to play in snow!&#8221;</p>
		</div>

		<p>Danny Meadow Mouse sang this, or at least he tried to
		sing it, as he skipped about on the snow that covered the
		Green Meadows. But Danny Meadow Mouse has such a
		little voice, such a funny little squeaky voice, that had you
		been there you probably would never have guessed that
		he was singing. He thought he was, though, and was enjoying
		it just as much as if he had the most beautiful voice in
		the world. You know singing is nothing in the world but
		happiness in the heart making itself heard.</p>

		<p>Oh, yes, Danny Meadow Mouse was happy! Why
		shouldn&#8217;t he have been? Hadn&#8217;t he proved himself smarter
		than old Granny Fox? That is something to make anyone
		<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32">&nbsp;</a>happy. Some folks may fool Granny Fox once; some may
		fool her twice; but there are very few who can keep right
		on fooling her until she gives up in disgust. That is just
		what Danny Meadow Mouse had done, and he felt very
		smart and of course he felt very happy.</p>

		<p>So Danny sang his little song and skipped about in the
		moonlight, and dodged in and out of his little round doorways,
		and all the time kept his sharp little eyes open for any
		sign of Granny Fox or Reddy Fox. But with all his smartness,
		Danny forgot. Yes, sir, Danny forgot one thing. He
		forgot to watch up in the sky. He knew that of course old
		Roughleg the Hawk was asleep, so he had nothing to fear
		from him. But he never once thought of Hooty the Owl.</p>

		<p>Dear me, dear me! Forgetting is a dreadful habit. If
		nobody ever forgot, there wouldn&#8217;t be nearly so much
		trouble in the world. No, indeed, there wouldn&#8217;t be nearly
		so much trouble. And Danny Meadow Mouse forgot. He
		skipped and sang and was happy as could be, and never
		once thought to watch up in the sky.</p>

		<p>Over in the Green Forest Hooty the Owl had had poor
		hunting, and he was feeling cross. You see, Hooty was
		hungry, and hunger is apt to make one feel cross. The
		<a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33">&nbsp;</a>longer he hunted, the hungrier and crosser he grew. Suddenly
		he thought of Danny Meadow Mouse.</p>

		</div>

		<p>&#8220;I suppose he is asleep somewhere safe and snug under
		the snow,&#8221; grumbled Hooty, &#8220;but he might be, he just
		<em>might</em> be out for a frolic in the moonlight. I believe I&#8217;ll go
		down on the meadows and see.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Now Hooty the Owl can fly without making the teeniest,
		weeniest sound. It seems as if he just drifts along
		through the air like a great shadow. Now he spread his
		great wings and floated out over the meadows. You know
		Hooty can see as well at night as most folks can by day,
		and it was not long before he saw Danny Meadow Mouse
		skipping about on the snow and dodging in and out of
		his little round doorways. Hooty&#8217;s great eyes grew brighter
		and fiercer. Without a sound he floated through the moonlight
		until he was just over Danny Meadow Mouse.</p>

		<p>Too late Danny looked up. His little song ended in a
		tiny squeak of fear, and he started for his nearest little
		round doorway. Hooty the Owl reached down with his
		long cruel claws and&#8212;Danny Meadow Mouse was caught
		at last!</p>

		<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">A Strange Ride and How It Ended</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>Danny Meadow Mouse often had sat watching Skimmer
		the Swallow sailing around up in the blue, blue sky.
		He had watched Ol&#8217; Mistah Buzzard go up, up, up, until
		he was nothing but a tiny speck, and Danny had wondered
		how it would seem to be way up above the Green Meadows
		and the Green Forest and look down. It had seemed
		to him that it must be very wonderful and beautiful. Sometimes
		he had wished that he had wings and could go up
		in the air and look down. And now here he was, he, Danny
		Meadow Mouse, actually doing that very thing!</p>

		<p>But Danny could see nothing wonderful or beautiful
		now. No, indeed! Everything was terrible, for you see
		Danny Meadow Mouse wasn&#8217;t flying himself. He was
		being carried. Yes, sir, Danny Meadow Mouse was being
		carried through the air in the cruel claws of Hooty the
		Owl! And all because Danny had forgotten&#8212;forgotten to
		watch up in the sky for danger.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page35" title="35">&nbsp;</a>Poor, poor Danny Meadow Mouse! Hooty&#8217;s great cruel
		claws hurt him dreadfully! But it wasn&#8217;t the pain that was
		the worst. No, indeed! It wasn&#8217;t the pain! It was the
		thought of what would happen when Hooty reached his
		home in the Green Forest, for he knew that there Hooty
		would gobble him up, bones and all. As he flew, Hooty
		kept chuckling, and Danny Meadow Mouse knew just
		what those chuckles meant. They meant that Hooty was
		thinking of the good meal he was going to have.</p>

		<p>Hanging there in Hooty&#8217;s great cruel claws, Danny
		looked down on the snow-covered Green Meadows he
		loved so well. They seemed a frightfully long way below
		him, though really they were not far at all, for Hooty was
		flying very low. But Danny Meadow Mouse had never
		in all his life been so high up before, and so it seemed to
		him that he was way, way up in the sky, and he shut his
		eyes so as not to see. But he couldn&#8217;t keep them shut. No,
		sir, he couldn&#8217;t keep them shut! He just <em>had</em> to keep opening
		them. There was the dear old Green Forest drawing
		nearer and nearer. It always had looked very beautiful to
		Danny Meadow Mouse, but now it looked terrible, very
		terrible indeed, because over in it, hidden away there
		<a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36">&nbsp;</a>in some dark place, was the home of Hooty the Owl.</p>

		<p>Just ahead of him was the Old Briar-patch where Peter
		Rabbit lives so safely. Every old bramble in it was covered
		with snow and it was very, very beautiful. Really everything
		was just as beautiful as ever&#8212;the moonlight, the
		Green Forest, the snow-covered Green Meadows, the Old
		Briar-patch. The only change was in Danny Meadow
		Mouse himself, and it was all because he had forgotten.</p>

		<p>Suddenly Danny began to wriggle and struggle. &#8220;Keep
		still!&#8221; snapped Hooty the Owl.</p>

		<p>But Danny only struggled harder than ever. It seemed
		to him that Hooty wasn&#8217;t holding him as tightly as at first.
		He felt one of Hooty&#8217;s claws slip. It tore his coat and hurt
		dreadfully, but it slipped! The fact is, Hooty had only
		grabbed Danny Meadow Mouse by the loose part of his
		coat, and up in the air he couldn&#8217;t get hold of Danny any
		better. Danny kicked, squirmed and twisted, and twisted,
		squirmed, and kicked. He felt his coat tear and of course
		the skin with it, but he kept right on, for now he was hanging
		almost free. Hooty had started down now, so as to get
		a better hold. Danny gave one more kick and then&#8212;he felt
		himself falling!</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37">&nbsp;</a>Danny Meadow Mouse shut his eyes and held his breath.
		Down, down, down he fell. It seemed to him that he never
		would strike the snow-covered meadows! Really he fell
		only a very little distance. But it seemed a terrible distance
		to Danny. He hit something that scratched him, and then
		plump! he landed in the soft snow right in the very middle
		of the Old Briar-patch, and the last thing he remembered
		was hearing the scream of disappointment and rage
		of Hooty the Owl.</p>

		<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">Peter Rabbit Gets a Fright</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>Peter Rabbit sat in his favorite place in the middle of
		the dear Old Briar-patch, trying to decide which way he
		would go on his travels that night. The night before he
		had had a narrow escape from old Granny Fox over in the
		Green Forest. There was nothing to eat around the Smiling
		Pool and no one to talk to there any more, and you know
		that Peter must either eat or ask questions in order to be
		perfectly happy. No, the Smiling Pool was too dull a place
		to interest Peter on such a beautiful moonlight night, and
		Peter had no mind to try his legs against those of old
		Granny Fox again in the Green Forest.</p>

		<p>Early that morning, just after Peter had settled down
		for his morning nap, Tommy Tit the Chickadee had
		dropped into the dear Old Briar-patch just to be neighborly.
		Peter was just dozing off when he heard the cheeriest
		little voice in the world. It was saying:</p>

		<div class="poem">
		    <p><a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Dee-dee-chickadee!</p>
		    <p>I see you! Can you see me?&#8221;</p>
		</div>

		<p>Peter began to smile even before he could get his eyes
		open and look up. There, right over his head, was Tommy
		Tit hanging head down from a nodding old bramble. In
		a twinkling he was down on the snow right in front of
		Peter, then up in the brambles again, right side up, upside
		down, here, there, everywhere, never still a minute, and
		all the time chattering away in the cheeriest little voice in
		the world.</p>

		<div class="poem">
		    <p>&#8220;Dee-dee-chickadee!</p>
		    <p>I&#8217;m as happy as can be!</p>
		    <p>Find it much the better way</p>
		    <p>To be happy all the day.</p>
		    <p>Dee-dee-chickadee!</p>
		    <p>Everybody&#8217;s good to me!&#8221;</p>
		</div>

		<p>&#8220;Hello, Tommy!&#8221; said Peter Rabbit. &#8220;Where&#8217;d you
		come from?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;From Farmer Brown&#8217;s new orchard up on the hill. It&#8217;s
		a fine orchard, Peter Rabbit, a fine orchard. I go there every
		morning for my breakfast. If the winter lasts long enough,
		I&#8217;ll have all the trees cleaned up for Farmer Brown.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Peter looked puzzled. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he asked.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Just what I say,&#8221; replied Tommy Tit, almost turning a
		<a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40">&nbsp;</a>somersault in the air. &#8220;There&#8217;s a million eggs of insects on
		those young peach trees, but I&#8217;m clearing them all off as
		fast as I can. They&#8217;re mighty fine eating, Peter Rabbit,
		mighty fine eating!&#8221; And with that Tommy Tit had said
		good-by and flitted away.</p>

		<p>Peter was thinking of that young orchard now, as he sat
		in the moonlight trying to make up his mind where to go.
		The thought of those young peach trees made his mouth
		water. It was a long way up to the orchard on the hill, a
		very long way, and Peter was wondering if it really was
		safe to go. He had just about made up his mind to try it,
		for Peter is very, very fond of the bark of young peach
		trees, when thump! something dropped out of the sky at
		his very feet.</p>

		<p>It startled Peter so that he nearly tumbled over backward.
		And right at the same instant came the fierce, angry
		scream of Hooty the Owl. That almost made Peter&#8217;s heart
		stop beating, although he knew that Hooty couldn&#8217;t get
		him down there in the Old Briar-patch. When Peter got
		his wits together and his heart didn&#8217;t go so jumpy, he
		looked to see what had dropped so close to him out of the
		sky. His big eyes grew bigger than ever, and he rubbed <!-- Original location of illo-3 -->
		<a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42">&nbsp;</a>them to make quite sure that he really saw what he thought
		he saw. Yes, there was no doubt about it&#8212;there at his feet
		lay Danny Meadow Mouse!</p>

		<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">The Old Briar-patch Has a New Tenant</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>Danny Meadow Mouse slowly opened his eyes and then
		closed them again quickly, as if afraid to look around. He
		could hear someone talking. It was a pleasant voice, not at
		all like the terrible voice of Hooty the Owl, which was the
		very last thing that Danny Meadow Mouse could remember.
		Danny lay still a minute and listened.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Why, Danny Meadow Mouse, where in the world did
		you drop from?&#8221; asked the voice. It sounded like&#8212;why,
		very much like Peter Rabbit speaking. Danny opened his
		eyes again. It <em>was</em> Peter Rabbit.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Where&#8212;where am I?&#8221; asked Danny Meadow Mouse
		in a very weak and small voice.</p>

		<p>&#8220;In the middle of the dear Old Briar-patch with me,&#8221;
		replied Peter Rabbit. &#8220;But how did you get here? You
		seemed to drop right out of the sky.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Danny Meadow Mouse shuddered. Suddenly he remembered
		everything: how Hooty the Owl had caught
		<a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44">&nbsp;</a>him in great cruel claws and had carried him through the
		moonlight across the snow-covered Green Meadows; how
		he had felt Hooty&#8217;s claws slip and then had struggled and
		kicked and twisted and turned until his coat had torn and
		he had dropped down, down, down until he had landed
		in the soft snow and knocked all the breath out of his little
		body. The very last thing he could remember was Hooty&#8217;s
		fierce scream of rage and disappointment. Danny shuddered
		again.</p>

		<p>Then a new thought came to him. He must get out
		of sight! Hooty might catch him again! Danny tried to
		scramble to his feet.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Ouch! Oh!&#8221; groaned Danny and lay still again.</p>

		<p>&#8220;There, there. Keep still, Danny Meadow Mouse.
		There&#8217;s nothing to be afraid of here,&#8221; said Peter Rabbit
		gently. His big eyes filled with tears as he looked at Danny
		Meadow Mouse, for Danny was all torn and hurt by the
		cruel claws of Hooty the Owl, and you know Peter has a
		very tender heart.</p>

		<p>So Danny lay still, and while Peter Rabbit tried to make
		him comfortable and dress his hurts, he told Peter all about
		how he had forgotten to watch up in the sky and so had
		<a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45">&nbsp;</a>been caught by Hooty the Owl, and all about his terrible
		ride in Hooty&#8217;s cruel claws.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, whatever shall I do now?&#8221; he ended. &#8220;However
		shall I get back home to my warm house of grass, my
		safe little tunnels under the snow, and my little store of
		seeds in the snug hollow in the old fence-post?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Peter Rabbit looked thoughtful. &#8220;You can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; said
		he. &#8220;You simply can&#8217;t do it. It is such a long way for a little
		fellow like you that it wouldn&#8217;t be safe to try. If you went
		at night, Hooty the Owl might catch you again. If you
		tried in daylight, old Roughleg the Hawk would be almost
		sure to see you. And night or day old Granny Fox or Reddy
		Fox might come snooping around, and if they did, they
		would be sure to catch you. I tell you what, you stay right
		here! The dear Old Briar-patch is the safest place in the
		world. Why, just think, here you can come out in broad
		daylight and laugh at Granny and Reddy Fox and at old
		Roughleg the Hawk, because the good old brambles will
		keep them out, if they try to get you. You can make just
		as good tunnels under the snow here as you had there, and
		there are lots and lots of seeds on the ground to eat. You
		know I don&#8217;t care for them myself. I&#8217;m lonesome sometimes,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46">&nbsp;</a>living here all alone. You stay here, and we&#8217;ll have
		the Old Briar-patch to ourselves.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Danny Meadow Mouse looked at Peter gratefully. &#8220;I
		will, and thank you ever so much, Peter Rabbit,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>And this is how the dear Old Briar-patch happened to
		have another tenant.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go, Peter Rabbit! Don&#8217;t go!&#8221; begged Danny
		Meadow Mouse.</p>

		<p>Peter hopped to the edge of the Old Briar-patch and
		looked over the moonlit, snow-covered meadows to the
		hill back of Farmer Brown&#8217;s house. On that hill was the
		young peach orchard of which Tommy Tit the Chickadee
		had told him, and ever since Peter&#8217;s mouth had watered
		and watered every time he thought of those young peach
		trees and the tender bark on them.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I think I will, Danny, just this once,&#8221; said Peter. &#8220;It&#8217;s
		a long way, and I&#8217;ve never been there before; but I guess
		it&#8217;s just as safe as the Meadows or the Green Forest.</p>

		</div>

		<p>And with that, Peter Rabbit left the dear safe Old Briar-patch,
		and away he went lipperty-lipperty-lip, across the
		Green Meadows towards the hill and the young orchard
		back of Farmer Brown&#8217;s house.</p>

		<p>Danny Meadow Mouse watched him go and shook his
		head in disapproval. &#8220;Foolish, foolish, foolish!&#8221; he said
		over and over to himself. &#8220;Why can&#8217;t Peter be content with
		the good things that he has?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Peter Rabbit hurried along through the moonlight,
		stopping every few minutes to sit up to look and listen. He
		heard the fierce hunting call of Hooty the Owl way over
		in the Green Forest, so he felt sure that at present there was
		nothing to fear from him. He knew that since their return
		to the Green Meadows and the Green Forest, Granny and
		Reddy Fox had kept away from Farmer Brown&#8217;s, so he did
		not worry about them.</p>

		<p>All in good time Peter came to the young orchard. It
		was just as Tommy Tit the Chickadee had told him. Peter
		hopped up to the nearest peach tree and nibbled the bark. <!-- Original location of illo-4 -->
		<a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50">&nbsp;</a>My, how good it tasted! He went all around the tree, stripping
		off the bark. He stood up on his long hind legs and
		reached as high as he could. Then he dug the snow away
		and ate down as far as he could. When he could get no
		more tender young bark, he went on to the next tree.</p>

		<p>Now though Peter didn&#8217;t know it, he was in the very
		worst kind of mischief. You see, when he took off all the
		bark all the way around the young peach tree he killed the
		tree, for you know it is on the inside of the bark that the
		sap which gives life to a tree and makes it grow goes up
		from the roots to all the branches. So when Peter ate the
		bark all the way around the trunk of the young tree, he had
		made it impossible for the sap to come up in the spring. Oh,
		it was the worst kind of mischief that Peter Rabbit was in.</p>

		<p>But Peter didn&#8217;t know it, and he kept right on filling
		that big stomach of his and enjoying it so much that he
		forgot to watch out for danger. Suddenly, just as he had
		begun on another tree, a great roar right behind him made
		him jump almost out of his skin. He knew that voice, and
		without waiting to even look behind him, he started for the
		stone wall on the other side of the orchard. Right at his
		heels, his great mouth wide open, was Bowser the Hound.</p>

		<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">Farmer Brown Sets a Trap</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>Peter Rabbit was in trouble. He had got into mischief
		and now, like everyone who gets into mischief, he wished
		that he hadn&#8217;t. The worst of it was that he was a long way
		from his home in the dear Old Briar-patch, and he didn&#8217;t
		know how he ever could get back there again. Where was
		he? Why, in the stone wall on one side of Farmer Brown&#8217;s
		young peach orchard. How Peter blessed the old stone wall
		in which he had found a safe hiding-place! Bowser had
		hung around nearly all night, so that Peter had not dared
		to try to go home. Now it was daylight, and Peter knew it
		would not be safe to put his nose outside.</p>

		<p>Peter was worried, so worried that he couldn&#8217;t go to
		sleep as he usually does in the daytime. So he sat hidden
		in the old wall and waited and watched. By and by he saw
		Farmer Brown and Farmer Brown&#8217;s boy come out into
		the orchard. Right away they saw the mischief which Peter
		had done, and he could tell by the sound of their voices that
		<a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52">&nbsp;</a>they were very, very angry. They went away, but before
		long they were back again, and all day long Peter watched
		them work putting something around each of the young
		peach-trees. Peter grew so curious that he forgot all about
		his troubles and how far away from home he was. He could
		hardly wait for night to come so that he might see what
		they had been doing.</p>

		<p>Just as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun started to go to bed
		behind the Purple Hills, Farmer Brown and his boy started
		back to the house. Farmer Brown was smiling now.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I guess that will fix him!&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Now what does he mean by that?&#8221; thought Peter.
		&#8220;Whom will it fix? Can it be me? I don&#8217;t need any fixing.&#8221;</p>

		<p>He waited just as long as he could. When all was still,
		and the moonlight had begun to make shadows of the trees
		on the snow, Peter very cautiously crept out of his hiding-place.
		Bowser the Hound was nowhere in sight, and everything
		was as quiet and peaceful as it had been when he first
		came into the orchard the night before. Peter had fully
		made up his mind to go straight home as fast as his long
		legs would take him, but his dreadful curiosity insisted
		that first he must find out what Farmer Brown and his boy
		<a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53">&nbsp;</a>had been doing to the young peach trees.</p>

		<p>So Peter hurried over to the nearest tree. All around the
		trunk of the tree, from the ground clear up higher than
		Peter could reach, was wrapped wire netting. Peter couldn&#8217;t
		get so much as a nibble of the delicious bark. He hadn&#8217;t
		intended to take any, for he had meant to go right straight
		home, but now that he couldn&#8217;t get any, he wanted some
		more than ever,&#8212;just a bite. Peter looked around. Everything
		was quiet. He would try the next tree, and then he
		would go home.</p>

		<p>But the next tree was wrapped with wire. Peter hesitated,
		looked around, turned to go home, thought of how
		good that bark had tasted the night before, hesitated again,
		and then hurried over to the third tree. It was protected just
		like the others. Then Peter forgot all about going home.
		He wanted some of that delicious bark, and he ran from
		one tree to another as fast as he could go.</p>

		</div>

		<p>At last, way down at the end of the orchard, Peter found
		a tree that had no wire around it. &#8220;They must have forgotten
		this one!&#8221; he thought, and his eyes sparkled. All around
		on the snow were a lot of little, shiny wires, but Peter didn&#8217;t
		notice them. All he saw was that delicious bark on the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54">&nbsp;</a>young peach tree. He hopped right into the middle of the
		wires, and then, just as he reached up to take the first bite
		of bark, he felt something tugging at one of his hind legs.</p>

		<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">Peter Rabbit Is Caught in a Snare</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>When Peter Rabbit, reaching up to nibble the bark of
		one of Farmer Brown&#8217;s young trees, felt something tugging
		at one of his hind legs, he was so startled that he
		jumped to get away. Instead of doing this, he fell flat on
		his face. The thing on his hind leg had tightened and held
		him fast. A great fear came to Peter Rabbit, and lying there
		in the snow, he kicked and struggled with all his might.
		But the more he kicked, the tighter grew that hateful thing
		on his leg! Finally he grew too tired to kick any more and
		lay still. The dreadful thing that held him hurt his leg, but
		it didn&#8217;t pull when he lay still.</p>

		<p>When he had grown a little calmer, Peter sat up to examine
		the thing which held him so fast. It was something like
		one of the blackberry vines he had sometimes tripped over,
		only it was bright and shiny, and had no branches or tiny
		prickers, and one end was fastened to a stake. Peter tried
		to bite off the shiny thing, but even his great, sharp front
		<a class="pagenum" id="page56" title="56">&nbsp;</a>teeth couldn&#8217;t cut it. Then Peter knew what it was. It was
		wire! It was a snare which Farmer Brown had set to catch
		him, and which he had walked right into because he had
		been so greedy for the bark of the young peach tree that
		he had not used his eyes to look out for danger.</p>

		<p>Oh, how Peter Rabbit did wish that he had not been so
		curious to know what Farmer Brown had been doing that
		day, and that he had gone straight home as he had meant
		to do, instead of trying to get one more meal of young
		peach bark! Big tears rolled down Peter&#8217;s cheeks. What
		should he do? What <em>could</em> he do? For a long time Peter sat
		in the moonlight, trying to think of something to do. At
		last he thought of the stake to which that hateful wire was
		fastened. The stake was of wood, and Peter&#8217;s teeth would
		cut wood. Peter&#8217;s heart gave a great leap of hope, and he
		began at once to dig away the snow from around the stake,
		and then settled himself to gnaw the stake in two.</p>

		<p>Peter had been hard at work on the stake a long time
		and had it a little more than half cut through, when he
		heard a loud sniff down at the other end of the orchard.
		He looked up to see&#8212;whom do you think? Why, Bowser
		the Hound! He hadn&#8217;t seen Peter yet, but he had already
		<a class="pagenum" id="page57" title="57">&nbsp;</a>found Peter&#8217;s tracks, and it would be but a few minutes
		before he found Peter himself.</p>

		<p>Poor Peter Rabbit! There wasn&#8217;t time to finish cutting
		off the stake. What could he do? He made a frightened
		jump just as he had when he first felt the wire tugging at
		his leg. Just as before, he was thrown flat on his face. He
		scrambled to his feet and jumped again, only to be thrown
		just as before. Just then Bowser the Hound saw him and
		opening his mouth sent forth a great roar. Peter made one
		more frantic jump. Snap! the stake had broken! Peter
		pitched forward on his head, turned a somersault, and
		scrambled to his feet. He was free at last! That is, he could
		run, but after him dragged a piece of the stake.</p>

		<p>How Peter did run! It was hard work, for you know he
		had to drag that piece of stake after him. But he did it,
		and just in time he crawled into the old stone wall on one
		side of the orchard, while Bowser the Hound barked his
		disappointment to the moon.</p>

		<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">Peter Rabbit&#8217;s Hard Journey</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>Peter Rabbit sat in the old stone wall along one side of
		Farmer Brown&#8217;s orchard, waiting for Mrs. Moon to put
		out her light and leave the world in darkness until jolly,
		round, red Mr. Sun should kick off his rosy bedclothes
		and begin his daily climb up in the blue, blue sky. In the
		winter, Mr. Sun is a late sleeper, and Peter knew that there
		would be two or three hours after Mrs. Moon put out her
		light when it would be quite dark. And Peter also knew
		too that by this time Hooty the Owl would probably have
		caught his dinner. So would old Granny Fox and Reddy
		Fox. Bowser the Hound would be too sleepy to be on the
		watch. It would be the very safest time for Peter to try to
		get to his home in the dear Old Briar-patch.</p>

		<p>So Peter waited and waited. Twice Bowser the Hound,
		who had chased him into the old wall, came over and
		barked at him and tried to get at him. But the old wall kept
		Peter safe, and Bowser gave it up. And all the time Peter
		<a class="pagenum" id="page59" title="59">&nbsp;</a>sat waiting he was in great pain. You see that shiny wire
		was drawn so tight that it cut into his flesh and hurt dreadfully,
		and to the other end of the wire was fastened a piece
		of wood, part of the stake to which the snare had been made
		fast and which Peter had managed to gnaw and break off.</p>

		<p>It was on account of this that Peter was waiting for Mrs.
		Moon to put out her light. He knew that with that stake
		dragging after him he would have to go very slowly, and
		he could not run any more risk of danger than he actually
		had to. So he waited and waited, and by and by, sure
		enough, Mrs. Moon put out her light. Peter waited a little
		longer, listening with all his might. Everything was still.
		Then Peter crept out of the old stone wall.</p>

		<p>Right away trouble began. The stake dragging at the
		end of the wire fast to his leg caught among the stones and
		pulled Peter up short. My, how it did hurt! It made the
		tears come. But Peter shut his teeth hard, and turning back,
		he worked until he got the stake free. Then he started on
		once more, dragging the stake after him.</p>

		<p>Very slowly across the orchard and under the fence on
		the other side crept Peter Rabbit, his leg so stiff and sore
		that he could hardly touch it to the snow, and all the time
		<a class="pagenum" id="page60" title="60">&nbsp;</a>dragging that piece of stake, which seemed to grow heavier
		and harder to drag every minute. Peter did not dare to go
		out across the open fields, for fear some danger might happen
		along, and he would have no place to hide. So he crept
		along close to the fences where bushes grow, and this made
		it very, very hard, for the dragging stake was forever catching
		in the bushes with a yank at the sore leg which brought
		Peter up short with a squeal of pain.</p>

		<p>This was bad enough, but all the time Peter was filled
		with a dreadful fear that Hooty the Owl or Granny Fox
		might just happen along. He had to stop to rest very, very
		often, and then he would listen and listen. Over and over
		again he said to himself:</p>

		<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, whatever did I go up to the young peach
		orchard for when I knew I had no business there? Why
		couldn&#8217;t I have been content with all the good things that
		were mine in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadows?
		Oh, dear! Oh, dear!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Just as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun began to light up the
		Green Meadows, Peter Rabbit reached the dear Old Briar-patch.
		Danny Meadow Mouse was sitting on the edge of it
		anxiously watching for him. Peter crawled up and started
		<a class="pagenum" id="page61" title="61">&nbsp;</a>to creep in along one of his little private paths. He got in
		himself, but the dragging stake caught among the brambles,
		and Peter just fell down in the snow right where he
		was, too tired and worn out to move.</p>

		<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">Danny Meadow Mouse Becomes Worried</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>Danny Meadow Mouse limped around through the
		dear Old Briar-patch, where he had lived with Peter Rabbit
		ever since he had squirmed out of the claws of Hooty the
		Owl and dropped there, right at the feet of Peter Rabbit.
		Danny limped because he was still lame and sore from
		Hooty&#8217;s terrible claws, but he didn&#8217;t let himself think much
		about that, because he was so thankful to be alive at all. So
		he limped around in the Old Briar-patch, picking up seed
		which had fallen on the snow, and sometimes pulling down
		a few of the red berries which cling all winter to the wild
		rose bushes. The seeds in these were very nice indeed, and
		Danny always felt especially good after a meal of them.</p>

		<p>Danny Meadow Mouse had grown very fond of Peter
		Rabbit, for Peter had been very, very good to him. Danny
		felt that he never, never could repay all of Peter&#8217;s kindness.
		It had been very good of Peter to offer to share the Old
		Briar-patch with Danny, because Danny was so far from his
		<a class="pagenum" id="page63" title="63">&nbsp;</a>own home that it would not be safe for him to try to get back
		there. But Peter had done more than that. He had taken
		care of Danny, such good care, during the first few days
		after Danny&#8217;s escape from Hooty the Owl. He had brought
		good things to eat while Danny was too weak and sore to
		get things for himself. Oh, Peter had been very good indeed
		to him!</p>

		<p>But now, as Danny limped around, he was not happy.
		No, sir, he was not happy. The truth is, Danny Meadow
		Mouse was worried. It was a different kind of worry from
		any he had known before. You see, for the first time in his
		life, Danny was worrying about someone else. He was
		worrying about Peter Rabbit. Peter had been gone from
		the Old Briar-patch a whole night and a whole day. He
		often was gone all night, but never all day too. Danny was
		sure that something had happened to Peter. He thought
		of how he had begged Peter not to go up to Farmer
		Brown&#8217;s young peach orchard. He had felt in his bones
		that it was not safe, that something dreadful would happen
		to Peter. How Peter had laughed at him and bravely started
		off! Why hadn&#8217;t he come home?</p>

		<p>As he limped around, Danny talked to himself:</p>

		<!-- Original location of illo-5 -->

		<div class="poem">
			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page65" title="65">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Why cannot people be content</p>
			<p>With all the good things that are sent,</p>
			<p>And mind their own affairs at home</p>
			<p>Instead of going forth to roam?&#8221;</p>
		</div>

		<p>It was now the second night since Peter Rabbit had
		gone away. Danny Meadow Mouse couldn&#8217;t sleep at all.
		Round and round through the Old Briar-patch he limped,
		and finally sat down at the edge of it to wait and watch. At
		last, just as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun sent his first long rays
		of light across the Green Meadows, Danny saw something
		crawling towards the Old Briar-patch. He rubbed his eyes
		and looked again. It was&#8212;no, it couldn&#8217;t be&#8212;yes, it <em>was</em>
		Peter Rabbit! But what was the matter with him? Always
		before Peter had come home lipperty-lipperty-lipperty-lip,
		but now he was crawling, actually <em>crawling!</em> Danny Meadow
		Mouse didn&#8217;t know what to make of it.</p>

		<p>Nearer and nearer came Peter. Something was following
		him. No, Peter was dragging something after him. At last
		Peter started to crawl along one of his little private paths
		into the Old Briar-patch. The thing dragging behind
		caught in the brambles, and Peter fell headlong in the
		snow, too tired and worn out to move. Then Danny saw
		<a class="pagenum" id="page66" title="66">&nbsp;</a>what the trouble was. A wire was fast to one of Peter&#8217;s
		long hind legs, and to the other end of the wire was fastened
		part of a stake. Peter had been caught in a snare!
		Danny hurried over to Peter and tears stood in his eyes.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Poor Peter Rabbit! Oh, I&#8217;m so sorry, Peter!&#8221; he whispered.</p>

		<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">Danny Meadow Mouse Returns a Kindness</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>There Peter Rabbit lay. He had dragged that piece of
		stake a long way, a very long way, indeed. But now he
		could drag it no farther, for it had caught in the bramble
		bushes. So Peter just dropped on the snow and cried. Yes,
		sir, he cried! You see he was so tired and worn out and
		frightened, and his leg was so stiff and sore and hurt him
		so! And then it was so dreadful to actually get home and
		be stopped right on your very own doorstep. So Peter just
		lay there and cried. Just supposing old Granny Fox should
		come poking around and find Peter caught that way! All
		she would have to do would be to get hold of that hateful
		stake caught in the bramble bushes and pull Peter out
		where she could get him. Do you wonder that Peter cried?</p>

		<p>By and by he became aware that someone was wiping
		away his tears. It was Danny Meadow Mouse. And Danny
		was singing in a funny little voice. Pretty soon Peter
		<a class="pagenum" id="page68" title="68">&nbsp;</a>stopped crying and listened, and this is what he heard:</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t any use to cry!</p>
			<p class="i2">Not a bit! Not a bit!</p>
			<p>Wipe your eyes and wipe &#8217;em dry!</p>
			<p class="i2">Use your wit! Use your wit!</p>
			<p>Just remember that to-morrow</p>
			<p>Never brings a single sorrow.</p>
			<p>Yesterday has gone forever</p>
			<p>And to-morrow gets here never.</p>
			<p>Chase your worries all away;</p>
			<p>Nothing&#8217;s worse than just to-day.&#8221;</p>
		</div>

		<p>Peter smiled in spite of himself.</p>

		<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right! That&#8217;s right! Smile away, Peter Rabbit.
		Smile away! Your troubles, sir, are all to-day. And between
		you and me, I don&#8217;t believe they are so bad as you think they
		are. Now you lie still just where you are, while I go see
		what can be done.&#8221;</p>

		<p>With that off whisked Danny Meadow Mouse as spry
		as you please, in spite of his lame leg, and in a few minutes
		Peter knew by little twitches of the wire on his leg that
		Danny was doing something at the other end. He was.
		Danny Meadow Mouse had set out to gnaw that piece of
		stake all to splinters. So there he sat and gnawed and
		gnawed and gnawed. Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun climbed
		<a class="pagenum" id="page69" title="69">&nbsp;</a>higher and higher in the sky, and Danny Meadow Mouse
		grew hungry, but still he kept right on gnawing at that
		bothersome stake.</p>

		<p>By and by, happening to look across the snow-covered
		Green Meadows, he saw something that made his heart
		jump. It was Farmer Brown&#8217;s boy coming straight over
		towards the dear Old Briar-patch.</p>

		<p>Danny didn&#8217;t say a word to Peter Rabbit, but gnawed
		faster than ever.</p>

		<p>Farmer Brown&#8217;s boy was almost there when Danny
		stopped gnawing. There was only a tiny bit of the stake
		left now, and Danny hurried to tell Peter Rabbit that there
		was nothing to stop him now from going to his most secret
		retreat in the very heart of the Old Briar-patch. While Peter
		slowly dragged his way along, Danny trotted behind to see
		that the wire did not catch on the bushes.</p>

		<p>They had safely reached Peter Rabbit&#8217;s secretest retreat
		when Farmer Brown&#8217;s boy came up to the edge of the dear
		Old Briar-patch.</p>

		<p>&#8220;So this is where that rabbit that killed our peach tree
		lives!&#8221; said he. &#8220;We&#8217;ll try a few snares and put you out of
		mischief.&#8221;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page70" title="70">&nbsp;</a>And for the rest of the afternoon Farmer Brown&#8217;s boy
		was very busy around the edge of the Old Briar-patch.</p>

		<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">Peter Rabbit and Danny Meadow Mouse Live High</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>Peter Rabbit sat in his secretest place in the dear Old
		Briar-patch with one of his long hind legs all swelled up
		and terribly sore because of the fine wire fast around it and
		cutting into it. He could hear Farmer Brown&#8217;s boy going
		around on the edge of the dear Old Briar-patch and stopping
		every little while to do something. In spite of his
		pain, Peter was curious. Finally he called Danny Meadow
		Mouse.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Danny, you are small and can keep out of sight easier
		than I can. Go as near as ever you dare to Farmer Brown&#8217;s
		boy and find out what he is doing,&#8221; said Peter Rabbit.</p>

		<p>So Danny Meadow Mouse crept out as near to Farmer
		Brown&#8217;s boy as ever he dared and studied and studied to
		make out what Farmer Brown&#8217;s boy was doing. By and by
		he returned to Peter Rabbit.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s doing, Peter, but he&#8217;s putting
		something in every one of your private little paths leading
		<a class="pagenum" id="page72" title="72">&nbsp;</a>into the Briar-patch from the Green Meadows.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; said Peter Rabbit.</p>

		<p>&#8220;There are little loops of that queer stuff you&#8217;ve got
		hanging to your leg, Peter,&#8221; continued Danny Meadow
		Mouse.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Just so!&#8221; said Peter Rabbit.</p>

		<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s put cabbage leaves and pieces of apple all
		around,&#8221; said Danny.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We must be careful!&#8221; said Peter Rabbit.</p>

		<p>Peter&#8217;s leg was in a very bad way, indeed, and Peter
		suffered a great deal of pain. The worst of it was, he didn&#8217;t
		know how to get off the wire that was cutting into it so.
		He had tried to cut the wire with his big teeth, but he
		couldn&#8217;t do it. Danny Meadow Mouse had tried and tried
		to gnaw the wire, but it wasn&#8217;t the least bit of use. But
		Danny wasn&#8217;t easily discouraged, and he kept working and
		working at it. Once he thought he felt it slip a little. He
		said nothing, but kept right on working. Pretty soon he
		was sure that it slipped. He went right on working harder
		than ever. By and by he had it so loose that he slipped it
		right off of Peter&#8217;s leg, and Peter didn&#8217;t know anything
		about it. You see, that cruel wire snare had been so tight
		<a class="pagenum" id="page73" title="73">&nbsp;</a>that Peter didn&#8217;t have any feeling except of pain left in his
		leg, and so when Danny Meadow Mouse pulled the cruel
		wire snare off, Peter didn&#8217;t know it until Danny held it up
		in front of him.</p>

		<p>My, how thankful Peter was, and how he did thank
		Danny Meadow Mouse! But Danny said that it was nothing
		at all, just nothing at all, and that he owed more than
		that to Peter Rabbit for being so good to him and letting
		him live in the dear Old Briar-patch.</p>

		<p>It was a long time before Peter could hop as he used to,
		but after the first day he managed to get around. He found
		that Farmer Brown&#8217;s boy had spread those miserable wire
		snares in every one of his private little paths. But Peter
		knew what they were now. He showed Danny Meadow
		Mouse how he, because he was so small, could safely run
		about among the snares and steal all the cabbage leaves and
		apples which Farmer Brown&#8217;s boy had put there for bait.</p>

		<p>Danny Meadow Mouse thought this great fun and a
		great joke on Farmer Brown&#8217;s boy. So every day he stole
		the bait, and he and Peter Rabbit lived high while Peter&#8217;s
		leg was getting well. And all the time Farmer Brown&#8217;s
		boy wondered why he couldn&#8217;t catch Peter Rabbit.</p>

		<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">Timid Danny Meadow Mouse</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>Danny Meadow Mouse is timid. Everybody says so, and
		what everybody says ought to be so. But just as anybody
		can make a mistake sometimes, so can everybody. Still, in
		this case, it is quite likely that everybody is right. Danny
		Meadow Mouse <em>is</em> timid. Ask Peter Rabbit. Ask Sammy
		Jay. Ask Striped Chipmunk. They will all tell you the same
		thing. Sammy Jay might even tell you that Danny is afraid
		of his own shadow, or that he tries to run away from his
		own tail. Of course this isn&#8217;t true. Sammy Jay likes to say
		mean things. It isn&#8217;t fair to Danny Meadow Mouse to
		believe what Sammy Jay says.</p>

		<p>But the fact is Danny certainly is timid. More than this,
		he isn&#8217;t ashamed of it&#8212;not the least little bit.</p>

		<p>&#8220;You see, it&#8217;s this way,&#8221; said Danny, as he sat on his
		doorstep one sunny morning talking to his friend, old
		Mr. Toad. &#8220;If I weren&#8217;t afraid, I wouldn&#8217;t be all the time
		watching out, and if I weren&#8217;t all the time watching out, I
		<a class="pagenum" id="page75" title="75">&nbsp;</a>wouldn&#8217;t have any more chance than that foolish red ant
		running across in front of you.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Old Mr. Toad looked where Danny was pointing, and
		his tongue darted out and back again so quickly that Danny
		wasn&#8217;t sure that he saw it at all, but when he looked for the
		ant it was nowhere to be seen, and there was a satisfied
		twinkle in Mr. Toad&#8217;s eyes. There was an answering twinkle
		in Danny&#8217;s own eyes as he continued.</p>

		<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t stand a particle more
		chance than that foolish ant did. Now if I were big and
		strong, like Old Man Coyote, or had swift wings, like
		Skimmer the Swallow, or were so homely and ugly-looking
		that no one wanted me, like&#8212;like&#8212;&#8221; Danny hesitated
		and then finished rather lamely, &#8220;like some folks I know,
		I suppose I wouldn&#8217;t be afraid.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Old Mr. Toad looked up sharply when Danny mentioned
		homely and ugly-looking people, but Danny was
		gazing far out across the Green Meadows and looked so
		innocent that Mr. Toad concluded that he couldn&#8217;t have
		had him in mind.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, thoughtfully scratching his nose, &#8220;I
		suppose you may be right, but for my part fear seems a very
		<a class="pagenum" id="page76" title="76">&nbsp;</a>foolish thing. Now, I don&#8217;t know what it is. I mind my
		own business, and no one ever bothers me. I should think
		it would be a very uncomfortable feeling.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; replied Danny, &#8220;but, as I said before, it is a very
		good thing to keep one on guard when there are as many
		watching for one as there are for me. Now there&#8217;s Mr.
		Blacksnake and&#8212;&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; exclaimed old Mr. Toad, turning as pale as
		a toad can turn, and looking uneasily and anxiously in
		every direction.</p>

		<p>Danny turned his head to hide a smile. If old Mr. Toad
		wasn&#8217;t showing fear, no one ever did. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I
		didn&#8217;t mean that he is anywhere around here now. What
		I was going to say was that there is Mr. Blacksnake and
		Granny Fox and Reddy Fox and Redtail the Hawk and
		Hooty the Owl and others I might name, always watching
		for a chance to make a dinner from poor little me. Do you
		wonder that I am afraid most of the time?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied old Mr. Toad. &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t wonder
		that you are afraid. It must be dreadful to feel hungry eyes
		are watching for you every minute of the day and night,
		too.&#8221;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page77" title="77">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s not so bad,&#8221; replied Danny. &#8220;It&#8217;s rather exciting.
		Besides, it keeps my wits sharp all the time. I am
		afraid I should find life very dull indeed if, like you, I
		feared nothing and nobody. By the way, see how queerly
		that grass is moving over there. It looks as if Mr. Blacksnake&#8212;Why,
		Mr. Toad, where are you going in such a
		hurry?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just remembered an important engagement with
		my cousin, Grandfather Frog, at the Smiling Pool,&#8221;
		shouted old Mr. Toad over his shoulder, as he hurried so
		that he fell over his own feet.</p>

		<p>Danny chuckled as he sat alone on his doorstep. &#8220;Oh,
		no, old Mr. Toad doesn&#8217;t know what fear is!&#8221; said he.
		&#8220;Funny how some people won&#8217;t admit what everybody
		can see for themselves. Now, I <em>am</em> afraid, and I&#8217;m willing
		to say so.&#8221;</p>

		<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">An Exciting Day for Danny Meadow Mouse</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>Danny Meadow Mouse started along one of his private
		little paths very early one morning. He was on his way to
		get a supply of a certain kind of grass seed of which he is
		very fond. He had been thinking about that seed for some
		time and waiting for it to get ripe. Now it was just right,
		as he had found out the day before by a visit to the place
		where this particular grass grew. The only trouble was it
		grew a long way from Danny&#8217;s home, and to reach it he
		had to cross an open place where the grass was so short
		that he couldn&#8217;t make a path under it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I feel it in my bones that this is going to be an exciting
		day,&#8221; said Danny to himself as he trotted along. &#8220;I suppose
		that if I were really wise, I would stay nearer home
		and do without that nice seed. But nothing is really worth
		having unless it is worth working for, and that seed will
		taste all the better if I have hard work getting it.&#8221;</p>

		<p>So he trotted along his private little path, his ears wide
		<a class="pagenum" id="page80" title="80">&nbsp;</a>open, and his eyes wide open, and his little nose carefully
		testing every Merry Little Breeze who happened along for
		any scent of danger which it might carry. Most of all he
		depended upon his ears, for the grass was so tall that he
		couldn&#8217;t see over it, even when he sat up. He had gone
		only a little way when he thought he heard a queer rustling
		behind him. He stopped to listen. There it was again, and
		it certainly was right in the path behind him! He didn&#8217;t
		need to be told who was making it. There was only one who
		could make such a sound as that&#8212;Mr. Blacksnake.</p>

		<p>Now Danny can run very fast along his private little
		paths, but he knew that Mr. Blacksnake could run faster.
		&#8220;If my legs can&#8217;t save me, my wits must,&#8221; thought Danny
		as he started to run as fast as ever he could. &#8220;I must reach
		that fallen old hollow fence-post.&#8221;</p>

		<p>He was almost out of breath when he reached the post
		and scurried into the open end. He knew by the sound of
		the rustling that Mr. Blacksnake was right at his heels.
		Now the old post was hollow its whole length, but halfway
		there was an old knot-hole just big enough for Danny
		to squeeze through. Mr. Blacksnake didn&#8217;t know anything
		about that hole; and because it was dark inside the old post,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page81" title="81">&nbsp;</a>he didn&#8217;t see Danny pop through it. Danny ran back along
		the top of the log and was just in time to see the tip of
		Mr. Blacksnake&#8217;s tail disappear inside. Then what do you
		think Danny did? Why, he followed Mr. Blacksnake right
		into the old post, but in doing it he didn&#8217;t make the least
		little bit of noise.</p>

		<p>Mr. Blacksnake kept right on through the old post and
		out the other end, for he was sure that that was the way
		Danny had gone. He kept right on along the little path.
		Now Danny knew that he wouldn&#8217;t go very far before he
		found out that he had been fooled, and of course he would
		come back. So Danny waited only long enough to get his
		breath and then ran back along the path to where another
		little path branched off. For just a minute he paused.</p>

		<p>&#8220;If Mr. Blacksnake follows me, he will be sure to think
		that of course I have taken this other little path,&#8221; thought
		Danny, &#8220;so I won&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Then he ran harder than ever, until he came to a place
		where two little paths branched off, one to the right and
		one to the left. He took the latter and scampered on, sure
		that by this time Mr. Blacksnake would be so badly fooled
		that he would give up the chase. And Danny was right.</p>

		</div>

		<p class="continued_paragraph">said Danny, as he trotted on his way for the grass seed he

		<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">What Happened Next to Danny Meadow Mouse</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>Danny is so used to narrow escapes that he doesn&#8217;t waste
		any time thinking about them. He didn&#8217;t this time. &#8220;He
		who tries to look two ways at once is pretty sure to see
		nothing,&#8221; says Danny, and he knew that if he thought too
		much about the things that had already happened, he
		couldn&#8217;t keep a sharp watch for the things that might
		happen.</p>

		<p>Nothing more happened as he hurried along his private
		little path to the edge of a great patch of grass so short
		that he couldn&#8217;t hide under it. He had to cross this, and all
		the way he would be in plain sight of anyone who happened
		to be near. Very cautiously he peeped out and looked
		this way and looked that way, not forgetting to look up
		in the sky. He could see no one anywhere. Drawing a long
		breath, Danny started across the open place as fast as his
		short legs could take him.</p>

		<p>Now all the time, Redtail the Hawk had been sitting in
		<a class="pagenum" id="page84" title="84">&nbsp;</a>a tree some distance away, sitting so still that he looked like
		a part of the tree itself. That is why Danny hadn&#8217;t seen
		him. But Redtail saw Danny the instant he started across
		the open place, for Redtail&#8217;s eyes are very keen, and he can
		see a great distance. With a satisfied chuckle, he spread his
		broad wings and started after Danny.</p>

		<p>Just about halfway to the safety of the long grass on the
		other side, Danny gave a hurried look behind him, and his
		heart seemed to jump right into his mouth, for there was
		Redtail with his cruel claws already set to seize him! Danny
		gave a frightened squeak, for he thought that surely this
		time he would be caught. But he didn&#8217;t mean to give up
		without trying to escape. Three jumps ahead of him was a
		queer-looking thing. He didn&#8217;t know what it was, but if
		there was a hole in it he might yet fool Redtail.</p>

		<p>One jump! Would he be able to reach it? Two jumps!
		There <em>was</em> a hole in it! Three jumps! With another frightened
		squeak, Danny dived into the opening just in time.
		And what do you think he was in? Why, an old tomato can
		Farmer Brown&#8217;s boy had once used to carry bait in when he
		went fishing at the Smiling Pool. He had dropped it there
		on his way home.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page85" title="85">&nbsp;</a>Redtail screamed with rage and disappointment as he
		struck the old can with his great claws. He had been sure,
		very sure of Danny Meadow Mouse this time! He tried to
		pick the can up, but he couldn&#8217;t get hold of it. It just rolled
		away from him every time, try as he would. Finally, in disgust,
		he gave up and flew back to the tree from which he
		had first seen Danny.</p>

		<div class="illo" id="illo-7">

			<p class="caption">Redtail the Hawk screamed with rage as Danny escaped. <!-- <a href="#page85" class="crossref">See page 85</a> --></p>
		</div>

		<p>Of course Danny had been terribly frightened when the
		can rolled, and by the noise the claws of Redtail made when
		they struck his queer hiding-place. But he wisely decided
		that the best thing he could do was to stay there for a while.
		And it was very fortunate that he did so, as he was very
		soon to find out.</p>

	<div id="chapter_23" class="chapter"><a class="pagenum" id="page86" title="86">&nbsp;</a>
		<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">Reddy Fox Grows Curious</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>Danny Meadow Mouse had sat perfectly still for a long
		time inside the old tomato can in which he had found a
		refuge from Redtail the Hawk. He didn&#8217;t dare so much as
		put his head out for a look around, lest Redtail should be
		circling overhead ready to pounce on him.</p>

		<p>&#8220;If I stay here long enough, he&#8217;ll get tired and go away,
		if he hasn&#8217;t already,&#8221; thought Danny. &#8220;This has been a
		pretty exciting morning so far, and I find that I am a little
		tired. I may as well take a nap while I am waiting to make
		sure that the way is clear.&#8221;</p>

		<p>With that Danny curled up in the old tomato can. But
		it wasn&#8217;t meant that Danny should have that nap. He had
		closed his eyes, but his ears were still open, and presently
		he heard soft footsteps drawing near. His eyes flew open,
		and he forgot all about sleep, you may be sure, for those
		footsteps sounded familiar. They sounded to Danny very,
		very much like the footsteps of&#8212;whom do you think?
		<a class="pagenum" id="page87" title="87">&nbsp;</a>Why, Reddy Fox! Danny&#8217;s heart began to beat faster as
		he listened. Could it be? He didn&#8217;t dare peep out. Presently
		a little whiff of scent blew into the old tomato can.
		Then Danny knew&#8212;it <em>was</em> Reddy Fox.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! I hope he doesn&#8217;t find that I am in here!&#8221;
		thought Danny. &#8220;I wonder what under the sun has brought
		him up here just now.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If the truth were to be known, it was curiosity that had
		brought Reddy up there. Reddy had been hunting for his
		breakfast some distance away on the Green Meadows when
		Redtail the Hawk had tried so hard to catch Danny
		Meadow Mouse. Reddy&#8217;s sharp eyes had seen Redtail the
		minute he left the tree in pursuit of Danny, and he had
		known by the way Redtail flew that he saw something he
		wanted to catch. He had watched Redtail swoop down and
		had heard his scream of rage when he missed Danny
		because Danny had dodged into the old tomato can. He
		had seen Redtail strike and strike again at something on
		the ground, and finally fly off in disgust with empty claws.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Now, I wonder what it was Redtail was after and why
		he didn&#8217;t get it,&#8221; thought Reddy. &#8220;He acts terribly put out
		and disappointed. I believe I&#8217;ll go over there and find out.&#8221;</p>

		<!-- Original location of illo-7 -->

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page89" title="89">&nbsp;</a>Off he started at a smart trot towards the patch of short
		grass where he had seen Redtail the Hawk striking at
		something on the ground. As he drew near, he crept very
		softly until he reached the very edge of the open patch.
		There he stopped and looked sharply all over it. There was
		nothing to be seen but an old tomato can. Reddy had seen
		it many times before.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Now what under the sun could Redtail have been after
		here?&#8221; thought Reddy. &#8220;The grass isn&#8217;t long enough for
		a grasshopper to hide in, and yet Redtail didn&#8217;t get what
		he was after. It&#8217;s very queer. It certainly is very queer.&#8221;</p>

		<p>He trotted out and began to run back and forth with his
		nose to the ground, hoping that his nose would tell him
		what his eyes couldn&#8217;t. Back and forth, back and forth he
		ran, and then suddenly he stopped.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; exclaimed Reddy. He had found the scent left
		by Danny Meadow Mouse when he ran across towards the
		old tomato can. Right up to the old can Reddy&#8217;s nose led
		him. He hopped over the old can, but on the other side he
		could find no scent of Danny Meadow Mouse. In a flash
		he understood, and a gleam of satisfaction shone in his
		yellow eyes as he turned back to the old can. He knew that
		<a class="pagenum" id="page90" title="90">&nbsp;</a>Danny must be hiding in there.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got you this time!&#8221; he snarled, as he sniffed at
		the opening in the end of the can.</p>

		<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
		<span class="chapter_name">Reddy Fox Loses His Temper</span></h2>
		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a></p>
		<p>Reddy Fox had caught Danny Meadow Mouse, and yet
		he hadn&#8217;t caught him. He had found Danny hiding in the
		old tomato can, and it didn&#8217;t enter Reddy&#8217;s head that he
		couldn&#8217;t get Danny out when he wanted to. He was in no
		hurry. He had had a pretty good breakfast of grasshoppers,
		and so he thought he would torment Danny a while before
		gobbling him up. He lay down so that he could peep in at
		the open end of the old can and see Danny trying to make
		himself as small as possible at the other end. Reddy grinned
		until he showed all his long teeth. Reddy always is a bully,
		especially when his victim is a great deal smaller and weaker
		than himself.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got you this time, Mr. Smarty, haven&#8217;t I?&#8221; taunted
		Reddy.</p>

		<p>Danny didn&#8217;t say anything.</p>

		<p>&#8220;You think you&#8217;ve been very clever because you have
		fooled me two or three times, don&#8217;t you? Well, this time
		<a class="pagenum" id="page92" title="92">&nbsp;</a>I&#8217;ve got you where your tricks won&#8217;t work,&#8221; continued
		Reddy, &#8220;so what are you going to do about it?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Danny didn&#8217;t answer. The fact is, he was too frightened
		to answer. Besides, he didn&#8217;t know what he could do. So
		he just kept still, but his bright eyes never once left Reddy&#8217;s
		cruel face. For all his fright, Danny was doing some hard
		thinking. He had been in tight places before and had
		learned never to give up hope. Something might happen
		to frighten Reddy away. Anyway, Reddy had to get
		him out of that old can before he would admit that he was
		really caught.</p>

		<p>For a long time Reddy lay there licking his chops and
		saying all the things he could think of to frighten poor
		Danny Meadow Mouse. At last he grew tired of this and
		made up his mind that it was time to end it and Danny
		Meadow Mouse at the same time. He thrust his sharp nose
		in at the opening in the end of the old can, but the opening
		was too small for him to get more than his nose in, and he
		only scratched it on the sharp edges without so much as
		touching Danny.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pull you out,&#8221; said Reddy and thrust in one black
		paw.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page93" title="93">&nbsp;</a>Danny promptly bit it so hard that Reddy yelped with
		pain and pulled it out in a hurry. Presently he tried again
		with the other paw. Danny bit this one harder still, and
		Reddy danced with pain and anger. Then he lost his temper
		completely, a very foolish thing to do, as it always is. He
		hit the old can, and away it rolled with Danny Meadow
		Mouse inside. This seemed to make Reddy angrier than
		ever. He sprang after it and hit it again. Then he batted it
		first this way and then that way, growing angrier and angrier.
		And all the time Danny Meadow Mouse managed
		to keep inside, although he got a terrible shaking up.</p>

		<p>Back and forth across the patch of short grass Reddy
		knocked the old can, and he was in such a rage that he
		didn&#8217;t notice where he was knocking it to. Finally he sent
		it spinning into the long grass on the far side of the open
		patch, close to one of Danny&#8217;s private little paths. Like a
		flash Danny was out and scurrying along the little path.
		He dodged into another and presently into a third, which
		brought him to a tangle of barbed wire left there by Farmer
		Brown when he had built a new fence. Under this he was
		safe.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Phew!&#8221; exclaimed Danny, breathing very hard. &#8220;That
		<a class="pagenum" id="page94" title="94">&nbsp;</a>was the narrowest escape yet! But I guess I&#8217;ll get that special
		grass seed I started out for, after all.&#8221;</p>

		<p>And he did, while to this day Reddy Fox wonders how
		Danny got out of the old tomato can without his knowing
		it.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
